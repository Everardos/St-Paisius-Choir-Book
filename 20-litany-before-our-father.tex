        Unto thee we offer our whole life and hope O Master, Lover of mankind, and we ask Thee, and pray Thee, and supplicate Thee, vouchsafe us to partake of Thy heavenly and dread Mysteries of this holy and spiritual Table, with a pure conscience, unto remission of sins, unto pardon of offenses, unto communion of thy Holy Spirit, unto inheritance of the kingdom of heaven, unto boldness towards Thee; not unto judgment , nor unto condemnation. 
        \switchcolumn
        O, our God, the God of salvation, do Thou teach us how we may worthily give thanks unto Thee for Thy benefits, through which Thou hast dealt and dealest with us. Having accepted these Gifts, O our God, do Thou purify us from every defilement of flesh and spirit, teach us to achieve holiness in Thy fear, that we, receiving a portion of Thy Holy Things in the witness of a pure conscience toward Thee, mayest be made one with the holy Body and blood of Thy Christ; and that having received them worthily, we may have Christ abiding in our hearts and mayest become a temple of Thy Holy Spirit.
        
        Yea, O our God, let none of us be guilty of these, Thy fearful and heavenly Mysteries, nor be infirm in soul and body by partaking of them unworthily, but enable us, even unto our last breath, worthily to receive a portion of Thy Holy Things, which is a support upon the road to life eternal, and an acceptable defense at the dread judgment seat of Thy Christ. That we also together with all the Saints who in all times have been pleasing unto Thee, mayest be made partakers of Thy eternal good things, which Thou hast prepared for those who love Thee, O Lord.
