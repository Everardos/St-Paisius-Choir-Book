        \tiny Remember, O Lord, this city (or town, or monastery) wherein we dwell, and every city and country and the faithful that dwell therein. Remember, O Lord, them that travel by sea, land, and air; the sick, the suffering, the imprisoned, and their salvation. Remember, O Lord, them that bear fruit and do good works in Thy holy churches, and them that are mindful of the poor, and upon us all send down thy mercy.

        \tiny Be mindful, O Lord, of every Bishop of the Orthodox who rightly divideth the word of Thy truth. Remember, also, O Lord, my unworthiness, according to the multitude of Thy bounties; pardon my every transgression, whether voluntary or involuntary, and withhold not, because of my sins, the grace of Thy Holy Spirit from these gifts here set forth. Remember, O Lord, the priesthood, the diaconate in Christ, and every order of clergy, and put not to confusion any one of us who stand about Thy holy altar. Visit us with Thy loving kindness, O Lord, manifest Thyself unto us through Thy rich compassions. Vouchsafe unto us seasonable and healthful weather. Send gentle showers upon the earth unto fruitfulness. Bless the crown of Thy years with goodness. Makest schisms to cease in the Church. Quench the raging of hostile nations, speedily destroy, by the power of Thy Holy Spirit uprisings of heresies, receive us all into Thy kingdom, showing us to be sons of the light and sons of the day, and grant unto us Thy peace and love, O Lord our God, for all things hast thou given unto us:

        Unto thee we offer our whole life and hope O Master, Lover of mankind, and we ask Thee, and pray Thee, and supplicate Thee, vouchsafe us to partake of Thy heavenly and dread Mysteries of this holy and spiritual Table, with a pure conscience, unto remission of sins, unto pardon of offenses, unto communion of thy Holy Spirit, unto inheritance of the kingdom of heaven, unto boldness towards Thee; not unto judgment , nor unto condemnation. 
        \switchcolumn
        O, our God, the God of salvation, do Thou teach us how we may worthily give thanks unto Thee for Thy benefits, through which Thou hast dealt and dealest with us. Having accepted these Gifts, O our God, do Thou purify us from every defilement of flesh and spirit, teach us to achieve holiness in Thy fear, that we, receiving a portion of Thy Holy Things in the witness of a pure conscience toward Thee, mayest be made one with the holy Body and blood of Thy Christ; and that having received them worthily, we may have Christ abiding in our hearts and mayest become a temple of Thy Holy Spirit.
        
        Yea, O our God, let none of us be guilty of these, Thy fearful and heavenly Mysteries, nor be infirm in soul and body by partaking of them unworthily, but enable us, even unto our last breath, worthily to receive a portion of Thy Holy Things, which is a support upon the road to life eternal, and an acceptable defense at the dread judgment seat of Thy Christ. That we also together with all the Saints who in all times have been pleasing unto Thee, mayest be made partakers of Thy eternal good things, which Thou hast prepared for those who love Thee, O Lord.
