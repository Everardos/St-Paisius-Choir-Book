    \item[] Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.
    \item[] Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
    \item[] Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.
    \item[] Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
    \item[] Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
    \item[] Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God.
    \item[] Blessed are they that are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.
    \item[] Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake.
    \item[] Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven.
    \item[] Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirt;
    \item[] Both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
