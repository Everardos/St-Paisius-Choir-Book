    \people I believe in one God, the Father Almighty,
    \item[] Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.
    \item[] And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
    \item[] the Only-begotten, begotten of the Father before all ages;
    \item[] Light of Light, true God of true God;
    \item[] begotten, not made; of one essence with the Father, by Whom all things were made;
    \item[] Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven,
    \item[] and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and became man;
    \item[] And He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was buried;
    \item[] And the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures;
    \item[] And ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father;
    \item[] And He shall come again, with glory, to judge both the living and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end.
    \item[] And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of life; Who proceedeth from the Father;
    \item[] Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spake by the prophets.
    \item[] In One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church.
    \item[] I confess one baptism for the remission of sins.
    \item[] I look for the resurrection of the dead,
    \item[] and the life of the world to come. Amen.
