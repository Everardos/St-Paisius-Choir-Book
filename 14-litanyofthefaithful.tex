        We thank Thee, O Lord God of Hosts, who hast vouchsafed us to stand even now before Thy Holy Altar, and to fall down before Thy compassion for our sins, and for the errors of the people. Receive, O God, our supplication; make us to be worthy to offer unto Thee supplications and entreaties and bloodless sacrifices for all Thy people. And enable us whom Thou hast placed in this Thy ministry, by the power of Thy Holy Spirit, without condemnation or faltering, with the clear witness of our conscience, to call upon Thee at all times and in every place, that, hearkening unto us, Thou mayest be gracious unto us in the multitude of Thy goodness.

        Thou, O Lord, hast shown unto us this great mystery of salvation. Thou hast vouchsafed us, Thy humble and unworthy servants, to be ministrants of Thy holy altar. Do Thou enable us with the power of Thy Holy Spirit for this ministry, that standing uncondemned before Thy holy glory, we may offer unto Thee a sacrifice of praise: For Thou art He who worketh all things in all men. Grant O Lord, also that our sacrifice for our sins, and for the errors of the people be acceptable and well pleasing before Thee.

        Again and often times we fall down before Thee, O Good One and Lover of mankind, that, regarding our supplication, Thou wilt cleanse our souls and bodies of all defilement of flesh and spirit, and grant us to stand guiltless and uncondemned before Thy holy altar. Grant also, O God, to them that pray with us, advancement in life and faith and spiritual understanding. Grant them ever to serve Thee with fear and love, and to partake, guiltless and uncondemned, of thy Holy Mysteries, and to be vouchsafed Thy heavenly kingdom.

        O God, who in mercy and compassion hast visited our lowliness; Who appointed us, Thy humble, and sinful, and unworthy servants to minister at thy holy altar in the presence of Thy holy glory: Do Thou strengthen us by Thy Holy Spirit for this service, and grant us speech in the opening of our mouth, with which to invoke the grace of Thy Holy Spirit upon the gifts that we desire to offer.
