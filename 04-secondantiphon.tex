\end{rubricmed}

\begin{liturgicaltext}
    \choir Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. Praise the Lord, O my soul! I will praise the Lord as long as I live; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being. Put not your trust in princes, in sons of men, in whom there is no salvation. When his breath departs, he returns unto his earth: on that very day his plans perish. The Lord will reign forever: Thy God, O Zion, to all generations.
    \item[] Both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
    \item[] Only begotten Son and Immortal Word of God, who for our salvation didst will to be incarnate of the holy Theotokos and ever-Virgin Mary, who without change didst become man, and wast crucified, O Christ our God, trampling down death by death, who art one of the Holy Trinity, glorified with the Father and the Holy Spirit: save us.
