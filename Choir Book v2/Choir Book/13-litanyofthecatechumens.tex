        O Lord our God, who dwellest on high and lookest down on things that are lowly, Who unto the human race hast sent forth salvation, Thine Only-Begotten Son and God our Lord Jesus Christ: Look upon Thy servants the catechumens, who have bowed their necks before Thee, and vouchsafe unto them at a seasonable time the laver of regeneration, the remission of sins, and the garment of incorruption; unite them to Thy Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church, and number them among Thy chosen flock.

        O Lord our God who dwellest in the heavens and lookest down upon all Thy works; look down upon Thy servants the Catechumens, who have bowed their necks before Thee, and grant them an easy yoke. Make them honorable members of Thy holy Church; and vouchsafe them the laver of regeneration, the remission of sins, and the garment of incorruption, unto the knowledge of Thee, our true God.
