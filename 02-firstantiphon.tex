    \choir Bless the Lord, O my Soul; blessed art Thou, O Lord. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me bless His holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits. Who forgives all thine iniquities, Who heals all thy diseases. The Lord is compassionate and merciful, longsuffering and of great goodness. Bless the Lord, O my soul: blessed art Thou, O Lord.
