        O Lord God Almighty, who alone art holy, Who dost accept a sacrifice of praise from them that call upon Thee with their whole heart: Accept also the supplication of us sinners, and bring it to Thy Holy Altar, and enable us to offer unto Thee both gifts and spiritual sacrifices for our sins and for the errors of the people, and vouchsafe us to find grace before Thee, that our sacrifice may be acceptable unto Thee, and that the good Spirit of Thy grace may rest upon us, and upon these Gifts set forth, and upon all Thy people.

        O Lord, our God, who hast created us and brought us into this life; Who hast shown us the way of salvation, Who hast granted us the revelation of heavenly mysteries: for Thou hast appointed us to this ministry by the power of Thy Holy Spirit; be pleased, therefore, O Lord, that we be servitors of Thy new covenant, ministers of Thy Holy Mysteries; accept us who draw nigh to Thy Holy Altar, according to the multitude of Thy mercies, that we may be worthy to offer to Thee this rational and bloodless sacrifice for our sins, and for the errors of the people; accepting which upon Thy holy and most heavenly and noetic Altar, as an odor of spiritual fragrance, do Thou send down upon us the grace of Thy Holy Spirit. Look down upon us, O God, and behold this our service, and accept it as Thou didst accept the gifts of Abel, the sacrifice of Noah, the offerings of Abraham, the priesthood of Moses and Aaron, and the peace offerings of Samuel. According as Thou didst accept of thy holy apostles this true ministry, receive thus also from the hands of us sinners these gifts in Thy goodness, O Lord; that having been vouchsafed to minister without blame at Thy holy altar, we may receive the reward of faithful and wise stewards in the awesome day of Thy just rewarding.
